# DBpedia GSoC projects
This repo is used to coordinate efforts around the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) (GSoC) program in the DBpedia community.

The Summer of Code program sponsors students to work on Open Source projects during the summer. Many students job during summer holidays to sustain their living. Instead of that, why not exercise your skills for three months while getting paid?

## Contribute
### Becoming a mentor
A mentor's role is to help the student with his work and grade him at the end of the program. In exchange you will get help to work on one of the projects that you are interested in advancing.

### Becoming a student
As a student, if you get picked, you will be paid for three months during the summer to work on one of the projects in the [list](https://github.com/dbpedia/GSoC/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aproject+label%3Agsoc-2018). If there are no projects in the list that you want to work on, talk to us. Bring your own ideas. We might still be interested to mentor you.
